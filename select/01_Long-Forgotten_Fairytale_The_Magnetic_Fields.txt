Someone told me you'd be here
Whispering these familiar things
Talking to my little pet, smoking the same old cigarettes
...I would have laughed

I saw you last in summertime
You said you hated long goodby-y-yes
You said, "There's nothing to explain, in every life a little rain"?
...etcetera

~ chorus ~
And a long-forgotten fairytale is in your eyes again
And I'm caught inside a dream world where the colors are too intense
...and nothing is making sense

There's a floating town of ire down in a mist of mystery
There's an old enchanted castle and the princess there is me
...decked-out like a Christmas tree
~ end chorus ~

I guess you've had your little joke
But I have lost my sense of hu-u-mor
My medication's wearing off, for it's just not strong enough
...to cover this.

Then you kissed me like before
I found myself wanting more
And you tell that little lie that kept me hypnotized
...another kiss

~ chorus ~

If somebody told me I'd succumb
If someone said I'd be so dumb
After all the sleepless nights, when I turned on all the lights
...I would have hit them

But I have turned the other cheek
My voice trembles, my knees are weak

And you beat me once again
And I know what happens then
...you raise the ante

~ chorus ~
